vinylSync is an application to be used while listening to vinyl records.
While the song plays, vinylSync will listen and recognize the song and 
ask the user if they would like to scrobble the song on LastFM.

Personally I love looking at my Spotify Wrapped stats every year but found
that songs I listen to on vinyl are excluded. This app is intended to be a
method of joining vinyl listens and Spotify/Apple Music listens so listening data
is more complete.

Clearly a work in progress please be kind :)
